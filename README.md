# Components

Components are extensions for NODE&amp;EDGES.
With components everybody can implement custom interfaces and logic to connect to 3rd party solutions.
For example if you need to include a specific device like a label printer, a robot arm or a cloud connection to your favourite objectstore, components are the solution.


## How to use

NODE&amp;EDGES relies on the famous [EXTISM Project](https://github.com/extism/extism).
That means you can code your component in almost any up to date programming language (for more information take a look at the [EXTISM](https://extism.org) website).
In this repository you will find the NODE&amp;EDGES default components e.g. for sending an email or accessing the microsoft graph api and of cause a skeleton component to guide you.

So simply start with the skeleton component and familiarize yourself with the API. 

There are also skeleton components for different languages to speed up your work ;-)
